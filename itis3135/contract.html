        <h2>Contract Agreement</h2>
        <p>I, <strong>Danny Moncada</strong>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my <strong>Spring 2025</strong>, <strong>ITIS3135</strong>, <strong>Web Development</strong> class with my instructor, <strong>Professor D.I. von Briesen</strong>.</p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class, it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e., external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
